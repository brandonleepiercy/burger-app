## Description

This is a simple demo app where a user can enter a string (a burger) and they can order the burger (post the string to the mySQL database), where the string will appear in the 'un-eaten' section above. Here, the user can select to 'devour' the burger (updates a boolean associated with the item in the mysql database) and the item will then appear on the other side of the screen. This app is meant to demonstrate an ability to create a barebones full-stack program which follows the MVC app paradigm. The app uses javascript, node, express, mysql and express handle bars to dynamically render the on-screen data."
